## 🔹 Input & Output Basics

Basic Python script to accept input from the user and display output.

You can find the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h9NTsgz5WaSRol5jPg6RXs7h6wD99Rm8).

## 🔸 Operators and Expressions

Covered:

- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)

You can find the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l4yKEo8oBnYpPlBHwgVnN4w_950weohT#scrollTo=GqbGTScx9z4x).

## 🔻 Conditional Statements (Control Flow)

Learned how to control the flow of a Python program using if, if-else, if-elif-else, and nested conditions.

Key concepts practiced:

✅ if — Executes a block only if condition is true

✅ if-else — Executes one block if true, another if false

✅ if-elif-else — Checks multiple conditions sequentially

✅ Nested if — Condition inside another condition

🧠 Used for decision-making in real-world logic like grading, login systems, and eligibility checks.

✔️ Exercises Practiced:

1. Positive, Negative, or Zero  
2. Even or Odd Checker  
3. Voting Eligibility  
4. Largest of Three Numbers  
5. Grading System  
6. Leap Year Checker  
7. Number in Range (1–100)  
8. Simple Login System  

✅ This marks the completion of control flow fundamentals in Python.

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Flowcharts (Visual Logic)

- **Even/Odd Checker**: Create a flowchart to check if a number is even or odd.
- **Calculator – Addition & Subtraction**: Create a flowchart for a basic calculator that performs addition and subtraction.
- **Find the Largest of Three Numbers**: Create a flowchart to find the largest number among three numbers.

### Exercise 2: Input/Output Basics
- Take the user's name and age, then print a greeting.
- Ask for two numbers and print their sum.
- Print data types of entered values.

### Exercise 3: Operator Practice
- Perform all arithmetic operations between two numbers.
- Compare two numbers using comparison operators.
- Use logical, identity, and membership operators.

### Exercise 4: Logical Check with if/elif/else
- Check if the number is greater than 10 AND even.
- Check if the number is less than 5 OR greater than 20.
- Check if the number is NOT equal to 15.

### Exercise 5: Assignment Operator
- Start with a variable `a = 10`.
- Add 5 to it.
- Subtract 3.
- Multiply by 2.
- Divide by 4.
- Print the final value after each operation.

### Exercise 6: Membership Operator
- Take a string input from the user.
- Check if the letter `'a'` is in it.
- Check if the word `'Python'` is in it.

### Exercise 7: Identity Operator
- Create two identical lists and check:
  - if they are the same object using `is`.
  - if they are not the same object using `is not`.

### Exercise 8: Conditional Statements (Control Flow)
- **Positive, Negative, or Zero**: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Even or Odd Checker**: Check if a number is even or odd.
- **Voting Eligibility**: Check if a person is eligible to vote (age ≥ 18).
- **Largest of Three Numbers**: Find the largest number among three numbers using `if-elif-else`.
- **Grading System**: Assign a grade based on the marks (e.g., `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `F`).
- **Leap Year Checker**: Check if a year is a leap year.
- **Number in Range (1–100)**: Check if a number is within the range 1–100.
- **Simple Login System**: Implement a basic login system that checks if the entered username and password are correct.
