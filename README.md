## 🔹 Input & Output Basics

Basic Python script to accept input from the user and display output.

You can find the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h9NTsgz5WaSRol5jPg6RXs7h6wD99Rm8).

## 🔸 Operators and Expressions

Covered:

- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)

You can find the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l4yKEo8oBnYpPlBHwgVnN4w_950weohT#scrollTo=GqbGTScx9z4x).

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Input/Output
- Take user's name and age, then print a greeting.
- Ask for two numbers and print their sum.
- Print data types of entered values.

### Exercise 2: Operator Practice
- Perform all arithmetic operations between two numbers.
- Compare two numbers using comparison operators.
- Use logical, identity, and membership operators.

### Exercise 3: Logical Check with if/elif/else
- Check if the number is greater than 10 AND even.
- Check if the number is less than 5 OR greater than 20.
- Check if the number is NOT equal to 15.

### Exercise 4: Assignment Operator
- Start with a variable a = 10
- Add 5 to it
- Subtract 3
- Multiply by 2
- Divide by 4
- Print the final value after each operation

### Exercise 5: Membership Operator
- Take a string input from the user
- Check if the letter 'a' is in it
- Check if the word 'Python' is in it

### Exercise 6: Identity Operator
- Create two identical lists and check:
- if they are the same object using `is`
- if they are not the same object using `is not`

🔻 Conditional Statements (Control Flow)
Learned how to control the flow of a Python program using if, if-else, if-elif-else, and nested conditions.

Key concepts practiced:

✅ if — Executes a block only if condition is true

✅ if-else — Executes one block if true, another if false

✅ if-elif-else — Checks multiple conditions sequentially

✅ Nested if — Condition inside another condition

🧠 Used for decision-making in real-world logic like grading, login systems, and eligibility checks.

✔️ Exercises Practiced:

1. Positive, Negative, or Zero
2. Even or Odd Checker
3. Voting Eligibility
4. Largest of Three Numbers
5. Grading System
6. Leap Year Checker
7. Number in Range (1–100)
8. Simple Login System


✅ This marks the completion of control flow fundamentals in Python.
