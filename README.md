## 🔹 Input & Output Basics

Basic Python script to accept input from the user and display output.

You can find the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1h9NTsgz5WaSRol5jPg6RXs7h6wD99Rm8).

## 🔸 Operators and Expressions

Covered:

- Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
- Assignment Operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)
- Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)

## 🧪 Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Input/Output
- Take user's name and age, then print a greeting.
- Ask for two numbers and print their sum.
- Print data types of entered values.

### Exercise 2: Operator Practice
- Perform all arithmetic operations between two numbers.
- Compare two numbers using comparison operators.
- Use logical, identity, and membership operators.

### Exercise 3: Logical Check with if/elif/else
- Check if the number is greater than 10 AND even.
- Check if the number is less than 5 OR greater than 20.
- Check if the number is NOT equal to 15.

### Exercise 4: Assignment Operator
# Start with a variable a = 10
# - Add 5 to it
# - Subtract 3
# - Multiply by 2
# - Divide by 4
# Print the final value after each operation

### Exercise 5: Membership Operator
# Take a string input from the user
# - Check if the letter 'a' is in it
# - Check if the word 'Python' is in it

### Exercise 6: Identity Operator
# Create two identical lists and check:
# - if they are the same object using `is`
# - if they are not the same object using `is not`
